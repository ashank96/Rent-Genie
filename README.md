# Rent-Genie
  An android app built using Dagger2, Retrofit, Rx-Java2, Google Places Api and GeoCoding,based on MVP design pattern.
  Conductor(Mosby) has been used in place of fragments.
  This app is using Data Binding for binding ui components to layout files which reduces much boiler plate code.
  
  The app locates the nearby rent houses, hotels, lodging and real-estates, 
  based on both: 
  --user current location and 
  --given address
  within a radius of of selectable distances ranging from 1km to 10km.
  
  The places are located and sorted based on their rating(high to low) within the selected radius.
